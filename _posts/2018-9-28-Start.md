title: Starting with Rust

---

This is the first of a series of posts in which I will describe my learning curve in Rust. I think the best way to learn a new language is to write code, so here we are.

The goals of this serie are:
- __Learn how to program a software with Rust__  
  I started to read the first chapter of the [official documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/2018-edition/) and it definitely makes my finger tingle to write an application.  
  I will document all my learnings (success and failures) in this blog.

- __Implement a basic neural network for classification from scratch__
  
- __Address new language concepts incrementally__  
  I will try to explain each new concepts that are proper to the Rust language as soosn as I need them.

- __Use only the basic modules provided with the language__  
  I will do my best to only use the most common packages provided by the Rust Project Developers. That means for example that I will implement all the machine learning algorithms I will need.
